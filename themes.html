                Power

            <p>
              African American archaeology questions whose voices appear in
              official archives. By comparing artifacts with written records,
              archaeologists show how power shaped what was recorded and what
              was ignored.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Key idea:</strong> Documents often reflect the
                perspectives of slaveholders, employers, or officials rather
                than Black communities.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Archaeological contribution:</strong> Material evidence
                helps recover labor, family, and resistance that are missing or
                distorted in the written sources.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Example sources:</strong> Scholarship by Maria Franklin
                and Charles Orser on plantations, households, and race.

              Representation
            </h2>
            <p>
              Many projects involve descendant communities who have direct ties
              to the sites being studied. Oral histories, family memory, and
              community priorities help guide research questions and
              interpretation.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Key idea:</strong> Archaeology is not only about the
                past, but also about how people today want their histories told.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Archaeological contribution:</strong> Collaborative work
                can reshape museum displays, signage, and public narratives
                about Black history.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Example sources:</strong> Case studies that involve
                churches, neighborhood groups, and family networks.

              Accountability
            </h2>
            <p>
              African American archaeology treats plantations, urban blocks,
              military posts, and cemeteries as connected landscapes. These
              spaces show how Black people created home, community, and politics
              across time.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Key idea:</strong> Sites of slavery and freedom are
                linked through migration, labor, and memory.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Archaeological contribution:</strong> Mapping houses,
                artifact clusters, and paths through space reveals how people
                moved, gathered, and organized daily life.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Example sources:</strong> Research that traces
                households from plantations into post-emancipation towns and
                cities.
