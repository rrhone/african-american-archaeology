                Power
            </h2>
            <p>
              Maria Franklin’s “Power to the People: Sociopolitics and the Archaeology of Black Americans” begins with a clear challenge to the discipline: to stop
               pretending that archaeology is neutral. She argues that “an apolitical archaeology is a dangerous academic myth,” since even when archaeologists 
               claim objectivity, their work often reproduces the same hierarchies and exclusions found in society. For Franklin, this is not just a theoretical 
               issue, it is an ethical one. Archaeology, she warns, has historically been used as a tool of power, manipulated by imperialists, nationalists, and 
               racists to reshape the past in service of their own agendas.
            </p>
            <p>
              Franklin calls for self-reflection as the first step toward change. Archaeologists, she writes, must ask who benefits from their interpretations 
              and who is silenced by them. This means acknowledging that “white, middle-class specialists” have long dominated the study of the Black past, often 
              speaking about African Americans rather than with them. The consequences are not abstract because when archaeologists fail to engage descendant communities, 
              they risk reinforcing racism, as seen in episodes like the New York African Burial Ground controversy, where early exclusion of Black voices bred deep mistrust. Franklin’s 
              call to action reframes power as something that must be shared, not imposed. To her, ethical archaeology is not only about recovering artifacts, it is about redistributing 
              authority over history itself. Her message remains urgent: archaeologists must “stand in judgment of [their] own sociopolitics” if their work is to have meaning beyond academia.

              Representation
            </h2>
            <p>
              Representation in archaeology refers to who is allowed to interpret the past, whose voices shape historical narratives, and how communities are portrayed through research. 
              Both the Kelvin & Hodgetts article and the Smith et al. piece make clear that representation is not merely about visibility, but about power and the authority to assign meaning 
              to sites, objects, and histories. Kelvin & Hodgetts argue that archaeology grew out of settler colonial institutions that positioned Western academic knowledge above Indigenous 
              and descendant worldviews, resulting in research that often reinforced colonial hierarchies rather than challenging them. Their critique highlights the long-standing issue that 
              archaeological narratives have traditionally centered white, male, heteronormative perspectives while marginalizing Black, Indigenous, women, and LGBTQ2S+ voices within both the 
              discipline and the interpretation of heritage. Smith et al. extend this concern by addressing the structural barriers that still restrict BIPOC participation in archaeology, from 
              unequal representation in leadership and publishing to the undervaluing of alternative knowledge systems. Their work demonstrates that a lack of representation is not 
              accidental but it is embedded in disciplinary history and institutional practice.

              The consequences of that exclusion become clear when we consider how Black communities have been visually and materially portrayed in the archaeological record. When interpretation 
              is controlled by outsiders rather than descendants, material culture is easily framed through stereotypes, deficit narratives, or racialized assumptions. A photograph of the 1941 
              two-story outhouse on Agnes Street, for example, can be understood as more than a historical image as it becomes a representation of how Black working-class life was publicly 
              depicted. In archives, newspapers, and planning documents, such images circulated to justify slum clearance and urban renewal projects, reinforcing the idea that Black neighborhoods 
              were unclean and inferior. Without community interpretation, archaeological sites like this risk being read as evidence of moral failure rather than as proof of structural neglect 
              and resilience. Yet when descendant perspectives are included, meaning shifts: the outhouse becomes a symbol of survival under discriminatory sanitation policy, the yard becomes a 
              locus of domestic labor and family identity, and the neighborhood emerges as a site of cultural continuity rather than deficiency.

              Accountability
            </h2>
            <p>
              Maria Franklin argues that archaeologists must confront how their work shapes public memory and power. She warns that when African American descendants are excluded 
              from research decisions, archaeology risks reinforcing racist narratives instead of challenging them. Her solution is accountability where archaeologists share authority, 
              listen to descendant communities, and recognize that the past is not theirs to own.
            </p>
            <p>
              In “Community-Accountable Archaeology and the Politics of Representation,” anthropologists Jun Sunseri and Albert Gonzalez expand Franklin’s argument by placing 
              accountability at the center of archaeological practice. While Franklin outlines why archaeologists must change, Sunseri and Gonzalez show how accountability can be 
              practiced in real community contexts. Their work emphasizes that archaeology must not speak for communities, but with them, co-producing knowledge in ways that respect 
              lived memory, cultural values, and historical trauma.

                Accountability, Slums, and the Politics of Representation
            </h3>
            <p>
               Paul Mullins and Lewis Jones examine how urban poverty and Black neighborhoods have been historically represented through slumming narratives. Their work shows that 
               archaeology does not simply recover artifacts but it participates in the politics of who gets to define Black life, who is visible, and who is erased. This case study 
               offers a detailed example of accountability in practice, demonstrating how archaeology can either reinforce harmful narratives or challenge them by working with community 
               voices rather than speaking for them.
            </p>
            <p>
               At the center of this case is Indianapolis’ near-Westside, a historically Black working-class neighborhood, that is repeatedly described as a “slum” across the twentieth century. 
               City officials, journalists, reformers, and urban planners circulated images of dilapidated outhouses, crowded housing, and trash-filled yards to mark Black communities as 
               social problems rather than as communities with agency, culture, and history. Mullins and Jones show how heavily the visual record fixated on decay. Page 34 includes a 1941 
               photograph of a two-story outhouse taken by realtor Howard W. Fieber, captured not to document life but to frame Black space as unclean and backward. Public archives preserved 
               these photographs as “evidence” of poverty, turning lived environments into spectacles for outside consumption.

               This is where accountability becomes crucial. Archaeology often inherits these biased records unquestioned. Without reflection, researchers risk reproducing these same 
               narratives and presenting material remains as proof of deficiency rather than as evidence of everyday survival under structural racism. Mullins and Jones push against that 
               tradition. Instead of retelling a familiar narrative of urban decline, they argue for reading artifacts relationally as traces of adaptation, community-building, and 
               resilience within unequal infrastructure. A row of backyard outhouses (shown on page 38) is not simply neglect; it reflects redlining, blocked municipal investment, and 
               discriminatory sanitation services. When contextualized with oral history and resident testimony, the landscape transforms from pathology to proof of structural violence 
               endured and resisted. The authors critique how early scholarship, reform photography, and even historic preservation projects focused on degradation to justify displacement. 
               Slum imagery supported the demolition of Black neighborhoods in the name of “urban renewal.” Homes were razed, communities scattered, and heritage erased under the guise of 
               progress. In this sense, archaeology that does not center accountability becomes complicit in dispossession. The case forces the question: Whose stories are being told, and 
               who benefits from their telling?
