                Power
            </h2>
            <p>
              Maria Franklin’s “Power to the People: Sociopolitics and the Archaeology of Black Americans” begins with a clear challenge to the discipline: to stop
               pretending that archaeology is neutral. She argues that “an apolitical archaeology is a dangerous academic myth,” since even when archaeologists 
               claim objectivity, their work often reproduces the same hierarchies and exclusions found in society. For Franklin, this is not just a theoretical 
               issue—it is an ethical one. Archaeology, she warns, has historically been used as a tool of power, manipulated by imperialists, nationalists, and 
               racists to reshape the past in service of their own agendas.
            </p>
            <p>
              Franklin calls for self-reflection as the first step toward change. Archaeologists, she writes, must ask who benefits from their interpretations 
              and who is silenced by them. This means acknowledging that “white, middle-class specialists” have long dominated the study of the Black past, often 
              speaking about African Americans rather than with them. The consequences are not abstract—when archaeologists fail to engage descendant communities, 
              they risk reinforcing racism, as seen in episodes like the New York African Burial Ground controversy, where early exclusion of Black voices bred deep mistrust. Franklin’s 
              call to action reframes power as something that must be shared, not imposed. To her, ethical archaeology is not only about recovering artifacts—it is about redistributing 
              authority over history itself. Her message remains urgent: archaeologists must “stand in judgment of [their] own sociopolitics” if their work is to have meaning beyond academia.

              Representation
            </h2>
            <p>
              Maria Franklin argues that archaeologists must confront how their work shapes public memory and power. She warns that when African American descendants are excluded 
              from research decisions, archaeology risks reinforcing racist narratives instead of challenging them. Her solution is accountability where archaeologists share authority, 
              listen to descendant communities, and recognize that the past is not theirs to own.
            </p>
            <p>
              In “Community-Accountable Archaeology and the Politics of Representation,” anthropologists Jun Sunseri and Albert Gonzalez expand Franklin’s argument by placing 
              accountability at the center of archaeological practice. While Franklin outlines why archaeologists must change, Sunseri and Gonzalez show how accountability can be 
              practiced in real community contexts. Their work emphasizes that archaeology must not speak for communities, but with them, co-producing knowledge in ways that respect 
              lived memory, cultural values, and historical trauma.
