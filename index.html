            Maria Franklin reminds us that archaeology has never been neutral. She calls the 
            idea of “apolitical archaeology” a dangerous myth, because even when archaeologists believe they are being objective, their work is shaped 
            by the politics, biases, and structures of the world they live in. Throughout the discipline’s history, those in 
            control of excavation and interpretation have often been white, university-trained specialists, while Black 
            communities whom are the very descendants connected to these sites that have rarely been invited to speak, collaborate, or lead.

            Franklin urges archaeologists to turn the lens inward. She argues that real accountability begins with reflection by asking not 
            just what we study, but who our work serves, who it excludes, and who gets to decide what the past means. When this reflection 
            is absent, archaeology can reinforce old hierarchies instead of dismantling them. We’ve seen this in moments like the early handling of 
            the New York African Burial Ground, where the absence of communication with Black communities led to mistrust and conflict. These 
            histories show what happens when authority is concentrated in academic hands rather than shared with the people whose ancestors are being studied.
